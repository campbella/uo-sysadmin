1) Created usergroup classusers to place classmates on the system.
2) Edited adduser.conf
	-changed GROUPHOMES=yes to allow home directories to be created as /home/groupname/user
	to help with better user management
	-changed DIR_MODE=0750 from 0755. This removes world readable permissions as a default
	for users.
