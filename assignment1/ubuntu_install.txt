Ubuntu Server 12.04 Installation Guide
Note: For this assignment we have selected Ubuntu Server based off the roubustness of its support and documentation.

Creating a bootable USB stick on Windows:
As recommended from the Ubuntu website we downloaded the Pen Drive Linux's USB Installer (<http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/>) The "Universal USB Installer aka UII is a Live Linux USB Creator that allowes you to choose from a selection of Linux Distributions to put on your USB Flash Drive."

Once downloaded, we found and opened the .exe file (Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.3.6), then agreed to the License Agreement by selecting "I Agree"

On the selection page,
Step 1: Select a Linux Distribution from the dropdown to put on your USB.
We selected "Ubuntu Server 12.04.2 i386 Installer."  We made this selection due to it's compatability with the Puppet software and the i386 version being compatable with out x36 machine.  This is not the default setting.

During this step, we selected the box "Opted to Download the iso" which brings up the appropriate Ubuntu page to begin the file download. The default is unchecked.  You can use a previously downloaded version not aquired by the UII and browse to it during the next step.

Step 2: Once your download has finished, Browse to and select the ISO.
Here we browesed to our file which was deposited in our Dowloads folder and selected it. (ubuntu-12.04.2-server-i386.iso)

Step 3: Select your USB Drive Letter Only.
We selected "F:\" the drive for the connected USB stick.  We also checked "Format F:\Drive (Erases Content)" to clear the USB of any data that might hinder the installation.  This will format the drive as Fat32. You will need to use a USB with a minimum of 2GB to prevent installation issues.

Based off our selections about, the Universal Installer will perform the following actions:
1) Close Explorer Windows - Allowes (F:) to be Fat32 Formatted
2) Fat32 Format (F:) - All Data will be Irrecoverably Deleted
3) Create Syslinux MBR on (F:) - Existing MBR will be Overwritten
4) Create Pendrive Label on (F:) - Existing Label will be Overwritten
5) Install (Ubuntu Server 12.04.2 i386 Installer) on (F:)

If these actions seem appropriate, to preform, you select "Yes" on the following screen.

The installer will now run.  For our settings, the process took around 5+ minutes.  When completed, it is okay to close out of any windows and eject the USB drive.

Install:
Insert USB -->Turn System on --> F12 --> System Startup --> Boot from usb

Language screen: Select English
Select Install Ubuntu Server from list
Select a Language: English
Select a Location: United States
Configure the Keyboard: No --> English (US) --> English (US) (It detects hardware)
It loads additional components and configures the network – you do nothing

If you aren't connected to the network you should get a warning after the configuration has completed.  We were not connected to the network due to security issues, displaying the warning.  Select continue to move on.

We are asked if we wanted to configure the network manually.  Choose “Do not configure the network at this time”

Configure the network: Enter the hostname for this system.
This is a single word that identifies your system to the network.  If you are on a shared network, it's good to let your system administrator know this name or ask what it should be.  If this is a personal network, you can choose something meaningful to you.  Continue moves you forward.

Set Up Users and Passwords: Full name for the new User
A user account will be created for you to use instead of the root account for non-administrative activities.  Here you enter the real name of this user.  This information will be used for instance as default origin for emails sent by this user as well as any program which displays or uses the user's real name.  Enter the full name for the new user.  Continue moves you forward.

Set Up Users and Passwords: Username for your account
Select a username for the new account.  The username should start with a lower-case letter, which can be followed by any combination of numbers and more lower-case letters. Enter username for your account.  Continue moves you forward.

Set Up Users and Passwords: Choose a password for the new user
A good password will contain a mixture of letter, numbers and punctuation and should be changed at regular intervals.  Choose a password for the new user.  Continue moves you forward.

Set Up Users and Passwords: Re-enter password to verify
Enter the same user password again to verify you have typed it correctly. Re-enter password to verify.  Continue moves you forward.

Set Up Users and Passwords: Weak Password
If you enter a password that consists of less than eight characters, which is considered too weak, you will be asked if you want to choose a stronger password.  If you want to use the original password, select yes, else no.

Set Up Users and Passwords: Encrypt your home directory
You may configure your home directory for encryption, such that any files stored there remain private even if your computer is stolen.  The system has the ability to mount your encrypted home directory each time you login and automatically unmount when you log out of all active sessions.  We selected yes, to encrypt our home directory.

Configure the Clock: Select your time zone
We selected Pacific

Partition Disks: Select Partitioning method: Guided – use entire disk (LVM option)
The installer can guide you through partitioning a disk (using different standard schemes) or, if you prefer, you can do it manually.  With guided partitioning you will still have a chance later to review and customize the results.  Of the options, we selected “Guided – use entire disk and set up LVM”

Partition Disks: Select disk to partition
Note: All data on the disk you select will be erased.  We selected our only available partition.

Partition Disks: Write the changes to disks to configure LVM
Before the LVM can be configured, the current partitioning scheme has to be written to disk.  These changes cannot be undone.  After the LVM is configured, no additional changes to the partitioning scheme of disks containing physical volumes are allowed during the installation.  Confirm your current partitioning scheme by selecting yes, else no.

Partition Disks: Amount of volume group to use for guided partitioning.
You may use the whole volume group for guided partitioning, or part of it.  If you use only part of it, or if you add more disks later, you will be able to grow logical volumes later using LVM tools, so using a smaller part at installation time may offer more flexibility.  We used the max which was pre-entered.  Continue moves you forward.

Patition Disks: Write the changes to disk?
If you continue, the changes listed on the screen will be written to the disks.  We selected yes to move forward.

Installing the Base system (You do Nothing)

Configuring tasksel: How do you want to manage upgrades on this system?
By default, updates need to be applied manually using package management tools.  Alternatively, you can choose to have this system automatically download and install security updates, or you can choose to manage this system over the web as part of a group of systems using Canonical's Landscape service.  We selected “No automatic updates.”

Software Selection: Choose Software to install
At the moment, only the core of the system is installed. To tune the system to your needs, you can choose to install one or more of the listed predefined collections of software.  We selected none of these and moved forward with continue.

Select and Install Software (You do Nothing)

Install the GRUB boot loader on a hard disk: Install the RUB boot loader to the master boot record?
If this new installation is the only operating system on the computer, it should be safe to install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record of your first hard drive.  Warning:  If the installer failed to detect another operating system that is present on your computer, modifying the master boot record will make that operating system temporarily unbootable, though GRUB can be manually configured later to boot it.  We selected “yes” to install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record.

Finishing the Installation (You do Nothing)

PAM Configuration: Continue to reboot
The installation is complete, so it is time to boot into the new system.  Remove the installation media, so that you boot into the new system rather than restarting the installation. Continue moves you forward.

(Note to change boot order)
